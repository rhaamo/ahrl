>>>>>>>>>>
*** Change auto select mode : change input anyway if band change

>>>>>>>>>>
*** Change DXCC tab to "DXCC Table"
*** Add "DXCC Summary" tab with a list consisting of the country and total counts, maybe modes and counts

*** Search

** Fixes to do
*** Form errors doesn't display which field is required, ambiguous

** Design
*** Stats.jinja2, DXCC table too large
*** Required form fields should have a red border or something
*** Replace lot of buttons by an icon
*** How to move the submit button on bottom of the stack ? (using extended wtf flask_security register form)
*** New QSO Form : add a pause-time checkbox
*** Edit QSO Form should use the same date / time of New, internally convert to time_on / time_off like New

** Tests

*** Delete QSO
*** Export ADIF
*** Import ADIF
*** Add/delete/view notes
*** Add QSO and search
*** Add QSO and test the two geo json
